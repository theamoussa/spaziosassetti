          <p>Louisa Gagliardi is in residence at Spazio Sassetti until May 10th.</p>
            <br>
          <p><b>Louisa Gagliardi</b> (b. 1989, Sion, Switzerland) lives and works in Zurich. Gagliardi received her BA in Graphic Design from ECAL (École cantonale d'art de Lausanne) in 2012. Working at the intersection of digital and tactile processes, she creates psychologically charged tableaus that are first rendered digitally, then printed on PVC and finished with hand-applied gel and varnish. Gagliardi’s work frequently explores themes of solitude, desire, and dislocation, capturing contemporary anxieties through flattened, glossy figuration.

                <p>On February 17, 2025, Spazio Sassetti welcomed its first artist-in-residence, Sedrick Chisom.</p>
<br>
<b>Sedrick Chisom</b> (b. 1989, Philadelphia, PA) leans into his own myth-making and historically-bound
    proclivities. As such, his paintings are caught between a recuperated past and apocalyptic future, all of
    which is grounded in a stage play written by the artist. He habitually borrows from this plot in order to
    arrive at images that are both haunted and mystic in nature. Chisom lives and works in London.
